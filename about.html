            Hello! I'm Yejin Kim. Welcome to my homepage.<br>
            I majored in Computer Engineering and worked as a translator and researcher.<br>
            As a student developer, I always wanted to become someone who can change the world by developing something.<br>
            I made a couple of Android applications for minorities when I was at the university.<br>
            After I got into Visualization Lab, I started to research AI.<br>
            More I'm doing the research, I felt skepticism about the research and development field.<br>
            Because I couldn't get the concept of a better world.<br>
            Now, I want to become an AI engineer for understanding the world itself.<br>
            For becoming a good engineer, I believe we must know how to handle data,<br>
            and share the whole process of what we are doing with others.<br>
            I hope to find someone who can go in the same direction that I'm heading during this program.<br>

            <br><br>
            Please don't hesitate to talk to me ðŸ˜€</h3>
